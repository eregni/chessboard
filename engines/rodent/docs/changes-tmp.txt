just to not forget user/builder visible changes

0. RodentIII requires C++14 compatible compiler.

1. polyglot books can be fully cached in memory, controlled by BOOK_IN_MEMORY_MB (default 16MB max), disabled by NO_BOOK_IN_MEMORY.
   if a book is loaded into memory RodentIII reports `success/m` otherwise `success/d`

2. during compiling macro BOOKSPATH defines where books live (absolute or relative path), default is "books/"
   during compiling macro PERSONALITIESPATH defines where personalities and `basic.ini` live (absolute or relative path), default is "personalities/"

3. now all books paths are relative to BOOKSPATH or absolute
   now all personalities paths are relative to PERSONALITIESPATH or absolute

4. new way of defining personalities aliases in `basic.ini`, use like
   `alias=path/path/name.txt`
   see included basic_example.ini for example.
   In this case RodentIII will show `Personality` combo in the options.
   It is possible to remove `PersonalityFile` from the options if user adds `HIDE_PERSFILE` to basic.ini`

5. BitScanForward and POPCNT are supported on x32 in VS2017. to disable POPCNT define NO_MM_POPCNT (vs2017 only)

6. `buildme_vs2017.bat` builds x32/x64/POPCNT/noPOPCNT executables using VS2017
   `buildme_vs2017.bat pgo` builds x32/x64/POPCNT/noPOPCNT profiled executables using VS2017

7. if RodentIII is configured to use personalities then it loads default personality "default.txt" on startup

8. if the NDEBUG macro isn't defined during compilation then RodentIII prints some additional debug info.

9. new uci parameter VerboseBook controls if RodentIII prints move choices from an opening book

10. On linux BOOKSPATH and/or PERSONALITIESPATH can be overridden by defining RIIIBOOKS and/or RIIIPERSONALITIES environment variables. if paths, pointed by RIIIBOOKS and/or RIIIPERSONALITIES don't exist then RodentIII uses built-in BOOKSPATH and/or PERSONALITIESPATH as fallbacks.

11. new uci command `stepp` = `step` + `print`
